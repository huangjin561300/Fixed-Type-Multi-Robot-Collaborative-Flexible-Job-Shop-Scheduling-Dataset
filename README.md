# Fixed-Type-Multi-Robot-Collaborative-Flexible-Job-Shop-Scheduling-Dataset
These cases vary by task counts (10, 15, 20, and 30), two sub-task counts (5 and 10), each task having one collaborative sub-task, and collaborative robot count options of 2, 3, and 4. Additionally, 50% of the non-collaborative sub-tasks are optionally processed, with
up to three optional robots per sub-task. Each sub-task time is uniformly distributed in the range of [10, 100].
It would be nice if you mention what each column value holds, these are raw files and no additional info is deducible from the data. Thanks
